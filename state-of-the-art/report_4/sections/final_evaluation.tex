\section{Final Evaluation}

We evaluated two research works, one related with \textbf{Interaction Methods} \cite{yimam2015interactive} that describes interaction methods for text annotations. The other is related with \textbf{Recommender Systems} \cite{knijnenburg2011each} where it was made a comparison with different ways of interaction with recommender systems. As we are interested in medical imaging annotations and as the fact that those authors are working in adaptive ML for text annotations, these methods could also be used by us and therefore their study can also represent a guideline to us. For the second work, it can be useful to us since the authors are representing different ways of interacting with a recommender system and, since we also want to have a kind of recommender system in our medical imaging annotations while the system is in a first approach, recommending the annotation. Both works are important because of the above reasons. So that, it is important to further analyse the two works and authors' research.
