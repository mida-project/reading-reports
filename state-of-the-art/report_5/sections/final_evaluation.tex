\section{Final Evaluation}

We evaluated three research works, starting by an introduction towards both \textbf{Gamification \& Crowdsourcing} \cite{dumitrache2013dr, aroyo2013crowd} topics while it describes the induction of \textbf{Gamification} and \textbf{Crowdsourcing} into the \textit{Health Informatics} field.

The second is related to \textbf{Gathering Annotated Data} \cite{inel2014crowdtruth} where authors showed the advantages of their open standards and framework extensibility with our medical imaging multimodalities and annotation tasks. Third and final, it was introduced a new approach for machine teaching \cite{zhu2013machine}, while their results compared interactive and non-interactive methods in different scenarios. The comparison might be relevant to our work is presenting the application and analysis of several interactive processes. All three jobs are necessary because of the above reasons. So that, it is essential to analyse the two works and authors' research further.
