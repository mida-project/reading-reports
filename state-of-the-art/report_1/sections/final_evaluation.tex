\section{Final Evaluation}

we have presented several research work from several authors. From Information Visualisation (InfoVis) experts, to Machine Learning (ML) ones, we found a large contribution to our work as described above. Based on their result evidence, we are now encourage to explore their work at a more deeper way by using their alternative methods for a further research of the effects of these alternatives on our system and interaction techniques.
