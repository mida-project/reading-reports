This repository contains work-in-progress material for our readings regarding our research work. Most of our research efforts for the [MIDA Project](https://github.com/mida-project/) can be found here. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
